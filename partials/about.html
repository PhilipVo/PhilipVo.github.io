		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>Hello, I'm Philip! I studied Computer Engineering at the Univeristy of California, Davis starting from 2009 and graduated in 2013 with my B.S. After two years of working on my 
		M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I decided to delve into the world of web development. Now, I can use my computer science knowledge to build all sorts of websites and applications!</p>

		<p>Coding is more than just a job to me; I've come to love it as a hobby that I am very passionate about. If you've worked with me, you know that I will gladly spend hours researching new computer science topics and implementing new technologies. I am also a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to coding so you'll find me refectoring and optimizing my code very frequently.</p>

		<p>I am very enthusiastic about learning new things, both science and non-science related! As part of my long list of hobbies, you can find me researching new technologies, reading science articles, and learning new languages (both computer AND human languages). </p>
 
		<p>In my spare time, I enjoy exploring my artistic side which involves drawing, playing guitar, and designing clothes. I also enjoy playing video games and working out.</p>
